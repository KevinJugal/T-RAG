Voicemail Password Resets: Direct customers to use the self-serve short code from their phone by dialing #PWD# or #793# and then press call button to reset their voicemail password. Password will reset to an 8 digit numeric code sent in a text message. Once the customer has reset their password, recommend they create a unique new voicemail password. Tell the users that will be able to do this after the current call finishes.
If the customer doesn't have access to the specific device, signal that you will pass them to an agent.

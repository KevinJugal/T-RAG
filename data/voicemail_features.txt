    - Credit the usage for this charge and advise customers that the charge is valid.
    - Credit should not exceed $5. Customers may need to contact a live agent to adjust the Billing Issue at the charge level.

- Charges in International roaming if device is off and call goes to voicemail:
    - Not charged for receiving voicemail while device remains turned off.
    - When the device is turned on while roaming, any voicemail received while the device was off is charged once registered on international towers.

Voicemail to text international usage:
    - Voicemail to text works internationally when the account is set up properly.
    - Voicemail is received as a text message, as long as message blocking is not active.
    - Voicemail to text with the Visual Voicemail Client: As long as data is on, which can be done dialing #RON# and pressing call button, voicemail messages is received in the Visual Voicemail client as a text message.

Voicemail converted to text while roaming:
    - Saves customer money because SMS is a lower cost than a received voicemail, only if the customer has voicemail delivery turned off.
    - Turning off delivery is for the SMS associated with the Voicemail to text feature. If customers have the device on when calls comes through, or turns the device on after a voicemail is left, but while still roaming internationally, they are charged for the VM deposit.
    - To turn off, customers need to access the Visual Voicemail app settings, then turn off Send as SMS.
